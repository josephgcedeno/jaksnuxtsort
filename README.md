## Learning

- Afther executing build file, you can test the dist folder by typing:
  ```
    serve -s dist
  ```
- Nuxt is a framework for vue. But much efficient and faster. SEO optimization. 
- Nuxt has control of head, title, meta, etc.
- Simple page routing because of the page folder, we can simply go to the specific route that match our file
- Choice between Universal or SPA
- We can also include UI Framework such as Boostrap.
